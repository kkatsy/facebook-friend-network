# facebook-friend-network

A little project that graphs and analyzes your facebook friend network. It was built off of [Yihui Fan](https://www.databentobox.com/2019/07/28/facebook-friend-graph/) 's article which, in turn, was built off of [Eliot Andre](https://github.com/EliotAndres/facebook-friend-graph) 's code, which was, also, built off of [Lucas Allen](https://github.com/lgallen/twitter-graph) 's original code.
After having built the friend graph, it uses the Louvain Community Detection algorithm to group friends into perceived categories. For some more info regarding how this algorithm works, check out [this article](https://medium.com/walmartglobaltech/demystifying-louvains-algorithm-and-its-implementation-in-gpu-9a07cdd3b010) .

**What I changed and added:**
- Updated HTML parsing to work with the Classic Facebook UI
- Parsing now extracts not only username but friends' names as well
- Added graph labeling options by full name, first name, and initials
- Organized code for easier reading
- Plus other minor changes/fixes/additions


**My Results:**
![my graph result](my_results/post-louvain.jpg)

When building the graph, I discarded friends with less than 3 mutual friends in order to get more clear and accurate cliques. As a result, I got a very interconnected network with only two small isolated cliques â€“ a consequence of being a university student and a Bay Area native, I suppose. I found Louvain's algorithm to be fairly successful at its grouping task, although it did mislabel a couple of my friends, generally those serving as a bridge between friend groups.

**Important details regarding running my code:**
- requirements
- read thru aforementioned article
- driver
- scraping takes time
- plotNetwork graphs louvain communities, networkAnalysis uses code from Yihui's article to examine/graph degree, closeness, and betweeness centraility
- networkStats is a work in progress. hope to eventually add more metric for Social Network Analysis
